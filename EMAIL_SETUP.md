# Email Setup Guide

## Required Environment Variables

To enable email functionality for the contact form, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

### SMTP Configuration

```bash
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@ohiogolfclubindoor.com
```

### Recommended for Vercel: Resend

**Resend** is the recommended email service for Vercel deployments. It's built specifically for developers and works perfectly with Next.js:

```bash
# Use Resend (Recommended for Vercel)
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.resend.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=resend
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-resend-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@ohiogolfclubindoor.com
```

**Why Resend?**

- Built by the Vercel team specifically for modern web apps
- Generous free tier (3,000 emails/month)
- Excellent deliverability rates
- Simple API and dashboard
- Built-in analytics and monitoring

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Add your domain `ohiogolfclubindoor.com` and verify it
3. Create an API key in the dashboard
4. Use the API key as your `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`

### Alternative: Vercel Email Integration

Vercel also supports direct email integration through their dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Integrations"
3. Add email providers like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Postmark
4. These often have special Vercel pricing and simplified setup

### Popular SMTP Providers

#### Gmail

```bash
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

**Note:** Use App Password, not your regular Gmail password. Enable 2FA first, then generate an App Password.

#### Outlook/Hotmail

```bash
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-password
```

#### Custom Domain (cPanel/WHM)

```bash
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=mail.yourdomain.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=info@ohiogolfclubindoor.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

## Default Email Recipients

- **Default recipient:** `info@ohiogolfclubindoor.com` (all contact form emails go here by default)
- **Custom recipients:** You can pass a `recipientEmail` prop to the ContactModal component to send to specific team members

## Spam Prevention Features

The contact form includes multiple spam prevention measures:

1. **Rate Limiting:** Max 5 submissions per IP per 15 minutes
2. **Honeypot Field:** Hidden field that bots typically fill out
3. **Time Validation:** Submissions under 2 seconds are blocked
4. **Email Validation:** Proper email format validation
5. **Content Filtering:** Blocks common spam patterns (URLs, spam keywords)
6. **Input Sanitization:** Prevents malicious content

## Usage Examples

### Default Usage (sends to info@ohiogolfclubindoor.com)

```jsx
<ContactModal isOpen={modalOpen} onClose={closeModal} subject="Contact Us" />
```

### Send to Specific Email

```jsx
<ContactModal
  isOpen={modalOpen}
  onClose={closeModal}
  subject="Brandon - Private Lessons"
  recipientEmail="brandon@ohiogolfclubindoor.com"
/>
```

## Testing

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Test with a legitimate form submission
3. Check spam filtering by:
   - Submitting too quickly (should be blocked)
   - Including URLs in the message (should be blocked)
   - Submitting multiple times rapidly (should be rate limited)

## Vercel Environment Variables

Since you're hosted on Vercel, you need to add your environment variables in two places:

### 1. Local Development (.env.local)

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.resend.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=resend
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-resend-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@ohiogolfclubindoor.com
```

### 2. Vercel Dashboard (Production)

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable with the same names and values
4. Make sure to select the appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)

**Important:** After adding environment variables to Vercel, you need to redeploy your application for them to take effect.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use App Passwords for Gmail instead of regular passwords
- **Recommended:** Use Resend for Vercel deployments for best performance and deliverability
- Monitor email logs for suspicious activity
- Store sensitive API keys in Vercel's secure environment variables, not in your code
